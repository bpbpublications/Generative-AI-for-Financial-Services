CEO Statement

At Company2, we firmly believe that sustainable and responsible business practices are essential for long-term value creation. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles guide how we operate, invest, and engage with our stakeholders. 2022 marked a pivotal year in accelerating our ESG strategy and impact.

On the environmental front, we set ambitious goals to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and lending portfolio by 2040. We issued $4 billion in green bonds and launched new sustainable investment products, driving significant capital toward climate solutions. Our focus on energy efficiency Projects across our facilities reduced emissions over 20%.

Socially, we took strides to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce and culture. We achieved pay equity for all employees globally and exceeded our goals for women and underrepresented minorities in leadership roles. Our philanthropic initiatives provided $18 million to community organizations promoting economic empowerment, education, and financial wellness.

We strengthened our governance foundation with an enhanced ESG risk management framework, human rights due diligence program, and ethics training. Our Board also formed a dedicated Sustainability Committee to provide focused oversight of our ESG strategy and performance.  

While proud of our progress, we know the road ahead remains challenging. Climate change, social inequity, and governance deficits continue posing systemic threats that require collective action. At Company2, we are committed to being a catalyst for positive change and sustainable progress.
