Company1 2022 ESG Report

Message from the CEO

At Company1, our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles is deeply ingrained in our culture and fundamental to how we create long-term value for our stakeholders. As a leading financial services firm, we have an opportunity and obligation to drive positive change through our investments, operations, and stakeholder engagement. 

In 2022, we made significant strides in advancing our ESG strategy and initiatives. We established ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We launched new sustainable investment solutions for clients, including an innovative climate solutions fund. And we made meaningful progress in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion within our firm and communities.

While I'm proud of our accomplishments, our journey is far from over. The challenges of climate change, social inequality, and poor governance practices remain enormous. We must continue pushing ourselves to develop impactful solutions and be a catalyst for progress. This report outlines our approach, key achievements, and future focus areas as we strive for sustainable, responsible growth.

I invite you to review our 2022 ESG Report and join us in building a more sustainable future.

Chief Executive Officer
